# AI-Learning-Environments

This repository contains AI course projects curated by **Pouria Sameti (TA)** under the supervision of **Dr. Hossein Karshenas** at the University of Isfahan.
<br>
project phases covering key AI domains such as **Markov Decision Processes (MDP), Reinforcement Learning (RL), First-Order Logic (FOL), and Game Playing**. The repository is designed to support students' understanding of theoretical concepts through practical coding exercises and projects. Each section reflects the progression of the course and offers valuable insights for learning, experimentation, and further development in the field of AI.

## Markov Decision Processes
This project provides a flexible and modular environment based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) paradigm. Students are tasked with implementing core reinforcement learning algorithms such as **value iteration, policy iteration, and Q-learning**. The environment includes stochastic transitions, intermediate states, and dynamic reward/penalty structures, encouraging students to explore various decision-making strategies.

### Objectives
- Gain hands-on experience with foundational RL algorithms in a controlled, stochastic setting.
- Experiment with reward shaping and penalties to influence agent behavior.
- Strategize and optimize policies to reach terminal states while satisfying cumulative score requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> A detailed **instruction PDF** is provided alongside the project files. This document explains the available environment functions and how to interact with them, guiding students in using the predefined interfaces to build and test their implementations.
